The `vanilla-otterly` branch preserves the state of the Otterly app at the moment of forking it.

# Otterly

Otterly is a local-first Markdown editor and privacy-focused note-taking app for people who want plain files, fast search, wiki-links, and desktop performance without accounts or cloud lock-in.

Your notes stay as normal Markdown files in a folder you control. Otterly adds the workflow you actually want on top: tabs, backlinks, search, git-aware status, themes, hotkeys, and a command-first omnibar.

## Features

### Writing and Formatting

Otterly keeps the editor close to Markdown while still feeling like a real writing tool. The goal is to make common structure, media, and formatting tasks feel native instead of plugin-dependent.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/readme-hero-dark.png" alt="Otterly editor with Markdown content, tabs, file tree, and formatting controls in the main writing view." width="92%">
</p>

<details>
<summary>Supported capabilities</summary>

- Headings, lists, checklists, tables, quotes, and fenced code blocks
- Slash-driven insertion flow for common block types
- Resizable code blocks with per-tab restore
- Inline and block images with paste/import support
- Resizable images and image captions in the editor
- Plain Markdown files on disk instead of a proprietary note format

</details>

### Navigation and Connected Notes

Search, commands, wiki-links, backlinks, and outlinks are part of the core workflow. You can move through a vault from the keyboard, then inspect note relationships without losing context.

  <img src="./assets/readme/readme-links.png" alt="Otterly links panel showing backlinks and outlinks for the current Markdown note." width="50%">
</p>

<details>
<summary>Supported capabilities</summary>

- One omnibar for files, note content, commands, and settings
- `[[wiki-links]]` with backlink and outlink views
- Full-text search across your vault
- File tree and folder navigation
- Starred notes for quick access
- Command-first flow for opening dialogs and actions without hunting through menus

</details>

### Tabs, Workflow, and Daily Use

Otterly is designed for working across multiple notes at once, not just opening one file at a time. Tabs, keyboard shortcuts, recent state, and quick vault actions are treated as first-class features.

### Themes and Personalization

Themes are not just a dark-mode toggle. Otterly supports built-in themes and editable user themes so you can tune typography, spacing, colors, and code presentation without changing your files.

</details>

### Versioning, Safety, and File Ownership

Otterly stays close to the filesystem while still giving you guardrails for day-to-day work. The app surfaces git-aware state and preserves enough workspace context that you do not lose your place when you come back.

<details>
<summary>Supported capabilities</summary>

- Plain Markdown notes in folders you control
- Git-aware file status in the workspace
- Version history and checkpoints from the app
- Dirty-tab tracking and save-aware close flows
- Session restore for open work
- Recent notes and starred paths persisted per vault

</details>

## Why Otterly

Most note apps ask you to choose between polished UX and file ownership.

Otterly is for people who want both:

- a privacy-focused note-taking app
- a local-first Markdown editor
- an Obsidian alternative that stays close to plain files
- a desktop notes app that does not require plugin hunting to feel usable

If you stop using Otterly, your notes are still just Markdown files in a folder you already own.
